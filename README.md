# This project is about my private website.

My website is nothing fancy or special. It is just a nice to have for me personally. 
Most of all, this is an opportunity to enhance my (currently still quite limited) frontend skills. It is
* mostly about HTML
* styling with CSS (without SASS or any frontend compilation to keep the setup simple)
* only minimum JavaScript to achieve wanted behavior

To avoid reinventing the wheel, the Bootstrap grid (v4.3.1) is also included to this project.
By using angular modules, header and footer can be included on multiple pages more easily compared to solutions, that are limited on HTML and JavaScript.

The website is planned to be hosted free of charge on: http://thom4s.bplaced.net
